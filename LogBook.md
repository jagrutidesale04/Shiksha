## 🖋️ Detailed Explanation of Each Week's Work

### Week I - Title Selection
Selected "Shiksha" to address student dropout rates using AI-driven tools and digital platforms, aligning with NEP 2020 objectives.

### Week II - Problem Statement and Justification
Defined the core issue of educational dropouts in marginalized sectors. Proposed building an integrated system to support and retain students.

### Week III - Software and Hardware Requirements
Finalized the tech stack: Python, Flask, ReactJS, MySQL, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, APIs, with standard i5, 8GB RAM system requirements.

### Week IV.1 - Model Research and Selection
Explored and compared ML models. Selected Random Forest for its predictive efficiency and interpretability.

### Week IV.2 - Data Collection and Preprocessing
Processed educational datasets, handling missing data, encoding features, scaling, and splitting for training and testing.

### Week IV.3 - Initial Model Training and Testing
Trained Random Forest on the preprocessed dataset. Achieved ~88% accuracy initially. Analyzed using confusion matrix and ROC curve.

### Week V.1 - Project Implementation I
Established backend (Flask + MySQL), basic frontend templates (ReactJS), and connected ML model with APIs. Structured scalable project folders.

### Week V.2 - Core Module Development
Developed Early Warning System, Learning Hub, and Mobile App prototype. Ensured backend-frontend connectivity.

### Week VI - Advanced Module Development
Completed modules: Financial Aid System, Parental Portal, Flexible Schooling. Integrated modules and started bug fixing.

### Week VII - Full System Integration and Testing
System-wide integration of mobile, web, and backend components. Conducted functional and performance testing.

### Week VIII - Project Presentation II
Demonstrated fully functional Shiksha platform. Showcased AI predictions, dashboards, and mobile app performance.

### Week IX - Report Writing: Documentation Preparation
Prepared final report with architecture diagrams, model evaluations, API documentation, and screenshots.

### Week X - Conclusion and References
Summarized achievements, challenges, solutions, learning outcomes. Compiled academic and technical references.

### Week XI - Final Project Report Submission
Submitted final report, GitHub repository, and all supporting documents.
