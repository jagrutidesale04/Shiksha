📚 Shiksha: Early Warning System for Reducing Student Dropout Rates
🚀 Project Overview
Student dropout rates in India remain a major challenge, particularly within marginalized communities, due to factors such as socio-economic conditions, limited access to quality education, and inadequate support systems. Reducing dropout rates is crucial for achieving equitable education and sustainable socio-economic development. In alignment with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which emphasizes the importance of retaining students at least up to the secondary education level, **Shiksha** is a technology-driven initiative aimed at providing innovative solutions to reduce dropout rates and improve student retention through predictive analytics and community engagement.
Shiksha integrates AI-powered early warning systems, mobile learning applications, parental engagement tools, and community learning hubs, all designed to offer timely support and intervention for at-risk students. This holistic approach ensures students receive personalized care, empowering them to stay on track and complete their education.
🎯 Project Objectives
The primary objectives of Shiksha are:
-Early Identification of At-Risk Students: Using AI and predictive analytics to identify students most at risk of dropping out.
