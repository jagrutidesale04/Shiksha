## üñãÔ∏è Detailed Explanation of Each Week's Work

### Week I - Title Selection
Selected "Shiksha" aligning with SIH1661 problem statement targeting educational dropouts. Analyzed NEP 2020 goals and project needs.

### Week II - Problem Statement and Justification
Drafted detailed problem analysis highlighting socio-economic and academic factors affecting dropout rates. Defined goals: early identification, student support, parental engagement.

### Week III - Software and Hardware Requirements
Finalized backend (Flask), frontend (ReactJS), mobile app (React Native), MySQL database. Chose TensorFlow and scikit-learn for model development.

### Week IV.1 - Model Research and Selection
Compared Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost. Selected Random Forest for interpretability and performance for early warning system.

### Week IV.2 - Data Collection and Preprocessing
Worked on real-world educational datasets, handled missing values, performed feature scaling, encoding, and training-testing data split.

### Week IV.3 - Initial Model Training and Testing
Initial training using Random Forest classifier. Achieved ~88% accuracy. Analyzed model using confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1 score.

### Week V.1 - Project Implementation I
Established system architecture: Flask APIs, ReactJS frontend templates, database schema for user and prediction data. Integrated basic ML model.

### Week V.2 - Core Module Development
Developed key modules: Early Warning Dashboard, Learning Hub platform, Mobile Learning App (prototypes for lessons, quizzes, tracking).

### Week VI - Advanced Module Development
Built Financial Aid Management System, Parental Engagement Portal, and Flexible Schooling Manager with real-time communication capabilities.

### Week VII - Full System Integration and Testing
Integrated backend, frontend, and mobile modules. Conducted integration, functional, and security testing across APIs and database systems.

### Week VIII - Project Presentation II
Presented full project functionality: real-time student risk predictions, resource hubs, mobile learning paths, and parental notifications.

### Week IX - Report Writing: Documentation Preparation
Drafted detailed report: background, methodologies, system architecture, dataset descriptions, model performance graphs, testing outcomes.

### Week X - Conclusion and References
Summarized project results, challenges, learnings. Compiled all references: NEP2020, UNESCO Reports, Kaggle Datasets, official library docs.

### Week XI - Final Project Report Submission
Submitted the final report, GitHub repository, project documentation, and SIH submission deliverables.
