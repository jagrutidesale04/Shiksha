## üìò Project Overview: *Shiksha ‚Äì An AI-Powered Solution to Reduce Student Dropout Rates in India*

Despite major advancements in the education sector, **student dropout remains a critical challenge** in India, particularly at the **secondary and higher secondary levels**. Contributing factors include poverty, gender inequality, lack of transportation, parental illiteracy, inadequate school infrastructure, and a shortage of trained teachers. These issues are even more pronounced in rural and tribal areas.

Aligned with the goals outlined in the **National Education Policy (NEP) 2020**, which emphasizes *universal access*, *inclusive education*, and *equity*, the **Shiksha** initiative leverages **cutting-edge technologies** to identify vulnerable students early and provide a robust support system. Through AI-driven analytics, mobile apps, and community platforms, Shiksha aspires to **bridge the education divide**, improve retention rates, and create an enabling ecosystem for every child to thrive academically and socially.

## üöÄ Detailed Description

**Shiksha** is not just a software application‚Äîit's an **integrated ecosystem** designed to revolutionize how educational institutions approach student retention. It brings together various stakeholders‚Äîstudents, parents, teachers, school administrators, NGOs, and local governments‚Äîon a unified platform. By enabling **data-driven decision-making**, Shiksha aims to foster **a proactive and preventive approach** to managing dropout risks rather than a reactive one.

It combines multiple digital tools and features, each tailored to address a specific aspect of the dropout crisis. These tools work together to form a cohesive solution, ensuring that **no student is left behind**.
