🎓 Shiksha: Early Warning System for Reducing Student Dropout Rates
________________________________________
📌 Problem Statement & Objectives
🔍 Problem Statement
Student dropout rates in India remain a critical challenge, especially impacting marginalized communities due to socio-economic and educational factors. Addressing this issue is essential for achieving equitable education and holistic socio-economic development. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 strongly emphasizes reducing dropout rates and ensuring quality education up to at least the secondary level.
To align with these goals, there is a need for innovative software solutions that leverage technology to identify, support, and retain students at risk of dropping out.
🎯 Objectives
•	To develop an AI-driven Early Warning System for predicting students at risk of dropping out.
•	To create digital platforms that provide community-based learning support and engagement.
•	To design mobile and web-based solutions that offer personalized education and flexible schooling.
•	To support parental engagement, financial aid management, and student counselling, improving overall student retention.
