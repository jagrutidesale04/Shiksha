🌟 Shiksha: Early Warning System for Reducing Student Dropout Rates
📎 Problem Statement & Objectives
🔍 Problem Statement
Student dropout rates in India are heavily influenced by socio-economic and educational factors, particularly affecting marginalized communities. Addressing these dropout rates is critical for equitable education and socio-economic development. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 highlights the importance of reducing dropout rates and ensuring access to quality education up to at least the secondary level.

🎯 Objectives
Develop AI-driven software solutions to identify and support at-risk students.

Implement personalized learning and community engagement tools.

Align with NEP 2020 goals for universal access and improved student retention.

Support holistic educational development across socio-economic backgrounds.
